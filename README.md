# Climate-Change-Misinformation-Detection
Although there is ample scientific evidence on climate change, there is still a lingering debate over fundamental questions whether global warming is human-induced. One factor that contributes to this continuing debate is that ideologically-driven misinformation is regularly being distributed on mainstream and social media. The challenge of the project was to build a system that detects whether a document contains climate change misinformation. The task is framed as a binary classification problem: a document either contains climate change misinformation or it doesnâ€™t. The caveat of the task is that we only have training documents with positive labels. That is, the training documents provided are articles with climate change misinformation only.
